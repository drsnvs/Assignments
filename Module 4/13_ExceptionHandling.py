# 13. Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?


# What is an Exception?
# An Exception is an error that happens during the execution of a program. Whenever there is an error, Python generates an exception that could be handled. It basically prevents the program from getting crashed.

# Why use Exceptions?
# Many a time, there are valid as well as invalid exceptions. Exceptions are convenient in many ways for handling errors and special conditions in a program. When you think that you have a code which can produce an error, you can use exception handling technique.

# Raising Exceptions in Python
# You can raise an exception in your program by using the raise exception statement. Raising an exception breaks current code execution and returns the exception back until it is handled.

# Common Exception Errors
# IOError (Input Output Error) – If the file cannot be opened

# ImportError – If Python cannot find the module

# ValueError – Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (normally ctrl+c or delete)


# What is an Error in Python?

# Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which changes the normal flow of the program. Two types of Error occurs in python. Syntax errors. Logical errors (Exceptions)
